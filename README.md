# AI Powered 3D website using React, ThreeJS and TailwindCSS

This website helps user identify how a t-shirt would look like using a 3d model. The user can upload their own logo and see it being applied to the t-shirt in real time.

## What users will be able to do?

-   They can change the color of the shirt.
-   Rotate the shirt a little with the cursor movement.
-   Upload and apply the logo of their choice
-   Convert the logo into a full texture being applied on the shirt in real time
-   Using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 APIs
-   Use DALL-E's API's to generate the logos for us

### My experience while building this project

This was my first project learning and building using ThreeJS. There were a lot of things that I didn't understand but it was a good start for me to learn how ThreeJS integrates with React and how to render models on the Frontend.

#### Credits

This project wouldn't have been possible without Adrian's free course on Youtube. You can look at the course here[https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZqEa8fTxypQ]
